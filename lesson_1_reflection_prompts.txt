How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    the pluses and minuses shown highlight the changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    uh, yes, duh

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    versioning, not committing in-process/broken code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    ummm....it's not even the same thing.  how weird. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    i don't know.  have we learned that yet? 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    rollback, baby!  

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to learn how to use it with other people.  i'm fine on my 
    own, but team dev on git confuses me.  

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

	rollbacks, fixes, breakage, changed minds, etc. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	laziness, completeness, control, computer fires....

	seriously?  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	log to view messages - better use those messages!
	and diff to find the changes.  thank goodness for GUIs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	didn't we answer this already? 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	this one too.
