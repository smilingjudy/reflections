What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   not much.  need to do it to create the main branch and get things
   ready to be added.  i imagine it creates this .git directory. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

   the staging area is stuff that's ready to go to the repo.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

   add and remove things from the stage as needed to group your commits. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

   enhancements vs bug fixes. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
