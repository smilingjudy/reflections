What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   not much.  need to do it to create the main branch and get things
   ready to be added.  i imagine it creates this .git directory. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

   the staging area is stuff that's ready to go to the repo.
